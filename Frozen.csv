"1","I first saw this in 2010 on a dvd which I own. As a fan of Adam Green, this film surpassed my expectations.
Revisited it few days back as I am planning to watch the remake Break.It is about three friends who get stranded in their ski lift chair far above the ground on a Sunday afternoon. One of the fella feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.
What we have here is bitter cold, frostbite, dangerous height n wolves.
The movie is scary n tension filled. The compound fracture scene is not for the squeamish. Very well done.
In most Bollywood films, the hero jumps from 10 floors n land straight on the ground like a cat without any compound fracture or shin bone breaking."

Ir leaves you feeling unsettled. A lot like 'Buried' did if you have seen that film.95% of the film is set in the same location but this doesn't mean it is boring at all. Absolutely not. So be prepared for an unsettling experience if you choose to watch this film.By no means is it bad though, it just motivates powerful feelings."

"7","A college student goes on a weekend ski/snowboard outing with his girlfriend and his jealous buddy. It was supposed to be just the guys, but Parker came along, much to buddy Lynch's dismay. She is still learning, and as a result of this, the trio spends most of the day on a bunny slope. After some complaining from Lynch, they decide to go on a quick run down the mountain before the day is through, but there's bad weather moving in. They manage to convince the lift operator to let them go, but through a series of unfortunate circumstances, the lift is stopped midway up the mountain leaving them stuck as the place shuts down for the week. With bad weather, the freezing cold and a large drop between them and the ground, the chances for survival are looking slim. And that's not taking the pack of hungry wolves into account.I caught this at the Parks Mall AMC back in February and thought it was fantastic. It's from the Open Water/Black Water/The Canyon school of survival horror. All of those films are intense portraits of people stuck in some form of wilderness nightmare with little hope of escape, but Frozen may just be my pick for best of the bunch. At one point early on into the trio's predicament, I discovered that I had unknowingly squeezed my hands together so tightly that they had fallen asleep, so it's safe to say that the tension got to me. The characters also really grew on me as the film wore on, and I actually felt really bad for them. This is Emma Bell's first film, and I was quite impressed with her performance. While she has a spotty moment or two, for a first-timer, I'd say she knocked it out of the park. Her standout scene takes place when she's relaying her fears about what might happen to her puppy if she dies on the lift, and if he'd think she abandoned him.Kudos to Adam Green for shooting this film on location. There are no green-screens or studio sets to be found here. Green and company found an actual lift to go out and shoot on. Equal amounts of kudos must go to the actors, as they were the ones up on the lift braving the elements for the authenticity a film of this type needs. Their hard work and tolerance paid off, as I often felt like I was right there on the lift with the characters. The chilly atmosphere vividly leaps off the screen, the bleak nature of the situation in which these three find themselves never in doubt. This film also hit a little closer to home for me, as I spent a week of skiing, etc. in Winter Park, CO not two months prior to watching this at the theater. With that fresh in my mind, I was left with an even stronger feeling of ""What if?"".Also effective is the sparingly used score, usually played over visuals of the abandoned ski park. There are some gruesome bits, particularly the hand scene from the trailer and a discovery towards the film's end, but most of the tension comes from the predicament itself and some of the debasing things the characters have to do. Needing to take a leak while stuck on a ski lift may not be a big deal if you're a guy, but Parker's options aren't so easy.I didn't think much of Adam Green's Hatchet. Frozen, on the other hand, is worth raving about."

"10","The magic of Frozen is that there's no badguy. It's just humans against nature. I was worried at first that the film would be slow paced. I mean, how many things can happen within such a small space?It turns out: plenty. Although time passes during the movie, the film does not give in to drawn out melodramatic sequences. They fight against nature, but the film is structured to attack them from all sides at once, but also in a way that's not transparently unrealistic. (Although personally I feel that nobody would have survived the cold and dehydration of the first night.)We even learn a little about the characters, in a way that's more convincing than most disaster films, I am thinking for example of The Poseidon Adventure. There are no stereotypes here.And they make mistakes. This isn't like Die Hard where the protagonist cleverly thinks of everything. Everything about the film, including their being trapped up so high, falls together like a series of coincidences, and that makes it even more horrific, because you start to believe that it might actually happen. There's even a little comedy to offset the horror, towards the beginning.There is some gore in the film, but hugely less than I was led to believe. This is no Quentin Tarantino film and no slasher film either.So having said what it's not, what is it? It's a thrilling look at how, even though we humans have extended ourselves into nature with technology, how reliant we are on that technology. It's an intellectual thriller rather than a supernatural or a serial killer freakshow thriller. It's normal people without heroic powers stuck in a situation that is near to real, the ""Lost in Translation"" of horror films.I though it was fantastic. I'll give Frozen a 9 out of 10."

"13","I spent a dollar and this at Redbox and I feel violated. This movie wouldn't make it as a circa 1970s made-for-television flick. If you dropped your glove in freezing temperatures wouldn't you put your hand in your pocket or something? Wouldn't it occur to at least 1 out of the 3 people to ZIP UP THEIR COAT all the way? Wouldn't any skier with even one run's worth of experience know that your feet freeze if you let them dangle off the chair lift for more than a few minutes? Wouldn't common sense dictate that you wrap your legs around the cable and slide down ""commando style"" instead of hanging your full weight from your frozen fingers? (I speak from experience here.) Couldn't they actually check to see if there are wolves in New England before writing them into the script? Why would the cable cut the guy's hands to ribbons? (They're maintained very carefully and kept greased. They are not ""sharp."") What are the odds they'd get stuck on the ONE chair with a loose bolt? Why was the ski resort closed all week when the next day's weather was perfect? This movie was written by people who have never been skiing, have no understanding of how chair lifts are constructed, couldn't be bothered to learn where wolves live and where they don't....what an embarrassment. And somebody thought this was a good enough idea that they ponied up several million dollars to make it. At least I'm only out a buck. It could be worse."
"14","I'm not jumping up and down for this one but I thought it was a very well done survival/thriller that had some shocking, gruesome scenes as well as some thrills and definitely chills. The acting was pretty decent but the stand out here is newcomer Emma Bell who gave an heartbreaking performance as one of the stranded skiers on a ski lift, man I felt all of her pain. I thought the director did a great job using different techniques with the camera and used his one location effectively that makes you think and feel that you're right there with them on that ski lift, the thought just terrifies me but doesn't make me fear going skiing just makes me think twice about going on a ski lift. I think it's a tad overrated saying it does for skiing what Jaws did for swimming, not really and to be honest it's more Open Water than Jaws just with more action and a different situation, sorry it just didn't put the fear in me, it just had me feeling sorry for them and rooting for them than actually being scared. It will have you thinking throughout questioning what would you do in that situation, what lengths would you go in order to survive and some of it to me wasn't plausible while other scenes were very realistic and will have you on the edge of your seat. What makes this so special is the fact that they took a simple idea and went to great lengths to make it powerful and had three leads that could be anyone's friend, sister, brother, lover and it makes you feel for them even more and makes the whole situation more unsettling and shattering with some scenes that will make you a little teary eyed, good effort. This film actually has a heart and is refreshing from most horror offerings lately but it's more of a drama/thriller and I can't wait to see what director Adam Green has up his sleeve next! Overall it could of had a slightly better conclusion and I don't think it's going to be the best genre flick of the year because I just don't see that happening but if you want to see something different, new and bone chilling go support Adam Green's latest effort Frozen, though more of a renter on a snowy night to me. Recommended!"

"17","I can almost guarantee that you will not enjoy this movie if you have ever done one of the following actions--Lived in snow -Been skiing -Been to the snow -Read a book about snow -Seen a movie that has snow in it -Spoken to someone who has seen snow -Accidentally turned your air conditioning down to low.Basically if you have any idea of what being in a cold environment might be like, then you will spend this entire movie picking faults and questioning the characters actions, because it seems like whoever wrote this script has not.One scene (very early so not a spoiler of any sort) shows a character noticing the other has frostbite on face. Points out the fact that they have it, but doesn't suggest zipping up their coat or even covering their face with the scarf they have uselessly positioned under their casually open coat. They carry on as if oblivious to the fact that the low temperatures are harmful in any way. This is just one small example of the stupidity of the main characters that you will inevitably come to hate, even wishing death upon, they deserve it, for making you sit and watch as they make one idiotic move after another against hazards that will have you scratching your head as to why they are hazards.There are a few interesting scenes, but it really is not worth the painful ""Why did you do that"" and ""That doesn't make any sense"" moments. Do yourself a favor and stick your tongue to a chairlift, you will have a less painful, and more interesting experience."

"20","First,on IMDb. Did you notice there is no ""goof"" section? Did you notice that the ""trivia"" section is crammed with chit chat about how difficult and dangerous was the filming? This is all from the production studio, it's a marketing trick to sell and advertise the most idiot, illogical, implausible move of the decade (maybe longer). There are so many illogical things (even assuming that the three skiers are completely brainless), it's not easy to write them down. Some among the ""not involved in this moron movie production"" reviewers already mentioned a few. I'll point out that: 1. the chairlift cable is at best at tree-top level, as can be seen in various scenes (say at 1:10:54, but there are various shot of the whole track, for ex. at 26:03), so that leaning from the bottom of the chair will make at best some 5-6 m. jump on fresh snow; 2. assuming that if you jump you won't jump to fall strait on your legs, you could instead make some sort of rope with whatever clothes and equipment you have with you; 3.the way to close a sky-lift is not to say ""wait for the last three to come down"" (which is illogical, as you don't know how many people form previous trips are still skiing on the mountain), its to put a red flag on a chair (as clearly seen at 18:56 ); 4. the resort could never be closed for days because of bad weather; in fact the morning after the sky is clearly clear and bright (1:10:00, even as at 1:12:00 is oddly already gray with heavy snow); such a closure in high season would result in dramatic loss of money; 5. if in such resort there are wolf packs roaming (which is quite improbable, given wolves habits), the whole track would at least been protected by a net-fence; this also prevents accidents if a skier would lose the track, or deliberately try to get off it; 6. before jumping try to get to the nearest pole, especially if your limb are not yet frozen and you are not wearing heavy and cumbersome ski-boots (she doesn't, for example); These are some of the illogical issues of the movie. I'm eager to see when the ""goof"" section will be created. It will be hilarious. The vote is 1 but fitting would be some -35."
"21","Halfway through the movie, I started rooting for the wolves. 'Nuff said.Like many offering very little stars to this movie, I have to agree that the premise is absurd, and getting yourself out of the situation, while quite challenging, wouldn't end with two deaths.Some observations:1. Yes, compound fractures hurt. But hey, what is this slippery stuff called snow? If my friends were in trouble, I'd slide down the hill on my back, dragging my ineffective stump of a leg with me.2. Ever seen A Christmas Story? Don't put your bare skin on frozen metal. Ever. Duh.3. Climb down - you have clothing, and a ski pole. It shouldn't be that difficult. Tie it together, form a rope, and get the hell out of there.4. Successful ski resorts are always teeming with human-hungry wolves, so be careful.5. You'll never get that 93 minutes of your life back."
"22","First of all let me start by saying, Frozen is a really GOOD movie. The reason why I never want to see it again because this is one of those movies that will haunt u forever. I went through some of the reviews & I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews, I agree to some extent with them, but some of those reviews are way exaggerated. I wasn't expecting much of the movie, I only predicted that I'm not going to like it, & I was wrong. The first half hour of the movie didn't grab my attention what so ever, the main characters don't really grow into u, in fact, you are going to hate them all a little bit. That being said, you can't stop but feel sorry & terrified by what happens to them after they got stuck up there, I was literally feeling & living the scenes with them & I was really disturbed/stressed/sad......., & all along one thing was going through my head, what if this happened to me, because lets face it, this has happened before & will happen again, & if you are unlucky u could end up going through the same. As much as the characters sucked, they didn't deserve that kind of death ""getting eaten by a pack of wolves ALIVE"", specially when they turn out not so bad after all, u will really feel sad for them. The scenes are too graphic, even to me (I see blood & guts & laugh: hahaa it's all makeup), I was holding my hands to my face most of the time & holding my breath every time something was coming up.. Stuff shown in this movie happens in real life that's why this movie will be like a slap in the face if u watch it & keep asking yourself, what if it was me in their shoe, what would I do, what would u wish u had learn before to help you save your life here.. We all know we're going to die one day, but it is unexpected, it could be in the most unexpected time or place, & watching this movie & putting yourself in their shoes, will make you appreciate your time & situation & might motivate you to finally do at least one the things you kept postponing all this time. Death is right around the corner, make sure u make the most of your moments alive."
"23","I managed to sit through this film but I suggest you avoid it, unless watching paint dry interests you. How much thrill/horror are you going to encounter, realistically, with 3 people trapped on a chair lift?! There are just too many possibilities for these people to escape their situation making it just too stupid to even sympathize or believe in the severity of their predicament. Spoilers: First, the guy jumps. Yes, it would be my first thought if I was put in that situation. However, I would have done everything to limit the potential for injury. They could have removed shirts, ski pants, etc and made a rope to hang from the lift so they're falling from a shorter distance. Second, the wolves. Come on! This is a ski area! They would never attack so aggressively. Possibly the first guy might have something happen because of his condition and blood, but definitely not the second guy. That drove me crazy. Lazy, uncreative writing. So much more drama could have been accomplished from developing the fallen guys situation than throwing in the wolf pack. Stupid. Lastly, the guy climbs down. He would never manage it. Never! He has been trapped in the cold overnight with no food or water. I would question some of the most athletic people being able to do that climb...especially with ski boots on! Ski gloves have leather patches to protect against cable damage by the way, has the writer ever been skiing?! The bunny hill uses cable lifts! Why not make it believable and have the guy use his legs on the cable to help distribute his weight and easier to traverse? Anyway, I wont go on and on about all the things that bothered me in this movie. It drove me nuts. I can handle some ""stretches"" of possibilities but if they are presented in the wrong way or go over the top it just flops. This definitely flopped for me. The tension wasn't there, you don't have any connection to the characters (hell I wanted them to die), nothing. All the reviews giving praise are either completely clueless, drunk or working for the producers of this movie."
"24","This movie was absolutely terrible. Let's leave aside the fact that they wouldn't have been stranded to begin with. The first character does a insane jump without using any common sense in order to break his legs which wouldn't have happened if he had done the jump from that high correctly or using the tools available to him. Next, since when are there man eating wolves in new hampshire or maine? This is absolutely mental and would never happen. They not only kill the injured man (maybe believable if they were starving) but they chase down and kill the uninjured second man after he does the normal thing of climbing (the way he even climbs it is so unrealistic and against all common sense, hand over handing it like superman instead of climbing on top of the wire) to the ladder tower. I mean really. This movie was just bad. Whatever. 1/10 and that's because there's no zero. Everyone else wh rated this movie must be clueless or have no common sense or have never gone skiing or not live in the Northeast etc etc etc. FAIL"
"25","SO I picked up Frozen from work and brought it home to watch. I read a few reviews on here first and I was a little leery after that.. but it wasn't what I expected. Usually wolves are badly depicted in films, terribly misrepresented and maligned, but not in this film. It keeps you grounded in terrible reality the whole time.Terrifying, brutal, bloody reality.. good acting, good story I really enjoyed this movie, and I generally don't like scary movies, I often find them cheesy and poorly acted. This film was different and I would really recommend watching it by yourself on a cold winters night.. It'll give you a nice chill."

"28","""Frozen"" is a beautifully crafted and original horror/thriller set on a ski lift. Now, you might watch the trailer like I did and thought, ""that is going to be so bloody boring! It's just three people sitting on a ski lift!"" But trust me, it's much more than that. Adam Green holds us there and always makes sure that we're captivated enough to keep watching. The characters were well-developed and likable, so you care about what's going to happen to them. It's also extremely thought provoking and realistic.The acting is very good, especially as Adam Green, the director, actually tortured the actors so they come across genuinely cold. The direction is claustrophobic and uncomfortable in a good way! There are also some horrible cringe-worthy moments which are genuinely horrific. The special effects and music were also top notch, with the chilly wind effects getting right up your nostril.Although it did run out of steam in some sections, for the most part it was an engaging and exciting film that was superbly acted and directed. Adam Green is proving himself to be a top notch director and clearly knows his stuff when it comes to making horror. I'd highly recommend watching this on a cold day, or on a hot day if you want a cool down."

"31","Essentially there's some people and they get trapped while using the ski-lift. They're stranded and things get worse when... well actually they're about as bad as things get.Incredibly, there are gory parts and surprisingly enough what little gore there is strikes deeper than many ""depraved"" films. Considering the amount of agony from merely spraining an ankle, seeing the amount of leg trauma one character suffers while jumping is something I'd dread to imagine! And then the skin-peeling scene was just, well, describable.The only problem is the protagonists scammed their way onto the lift, which makes it a little less believable they, specifically, would be the ones left trapped on a lift."
"32","The director (whom I didn't know before this movie) gets to generate an authentic tension from a real suspense story: the panic gripping the trio is absolutely palpable, although the strong implausibility of no one having a cellphone is not that believable. The terror due to their predicament mounts minute by minute and is made genuine by showing a harsh environment and by imposing tension on each of the characters. The cast is not famous at all but the way the story is set and the three personalities are described keeps attention and tension high and strong. I recommend it also for the wonderful location (movie shot in Utah's Rockies)."

"35","For a film that mainly revolves around a cast of three to carry the movie, seven stars can seem like seventeen. What makes this film work is the realism. Every choice, every consequence, everything! Like a movie studio trying to emulate the moments before a car accident, then its aftermath.I'm not one of these reviewers that will take you through the entire plot of the film. Especially in this case. This film's simplicity works. Three skiers accidentally get forgotten on a ski lift as the resort closes for the week.That's it! Yet, this simple formula works better than any horror movie I have seen in a long, LONG time! This opinion may be a little biased and I'll tell you why. Personally, I am petrified of open heights. Adam Green's chosen camera placements are well picked, never once allowing any hints of fiction into the story. That's the beauty of shooting on location, despite how deadly the location can be.Deadly, indeed! This movie really got under my skin. Not in anyway gore-filled, like ""Hatchet"" or its sequel. So for all the gore-hounds out there scanning the reviews for bloody details before watching it, make-up effects enthusiasts won't be completely disappointed, but it's no ""Hatchtet"". However, Adam Green focuses more on his Actor's/Actresses' reactions to the horrors within the film. This works! Lord, does it work! I'm a huge GOREHOUND, I welcome squeamish scenes, but the subtle incidents that happen to these characters while exposed to harsh weather works better than a graphic depiction of a chainsaw to the gut! I'm almost ashamed to admit that I had to turn away and groan at what I witnessed on screen! This is from someone who giggled like a girl-scout throughout ""A Serbian Film""! ""Frozen"" works! In all the right ways! My only complaints about the film are the lack of themes. Usually a survival-horror like this contains some smug theme that ties the film together, a topic the film tries to make aware to its audience. Romero does the aforementioned flawlessly, just to provide one example. ""Dawn of the Dead"" and its issue of consumerism. For example, one would assume that being trapped with two other people in a situation like that, the throes of ""cabin fever"" would naturally work its way into the script. Yet, Adam Green chooses to focus on the reality of the situation his characters find themselves in. As a result, the film remains simple. Leaving the audience with no other thought to ponder upon besides their own feelings of fear. To some, this may be a compliment to the film, to others, a weak link.The dialogue is probably the strongest device in the film. Revolving your film around only three characters, the script better be able to keep the dialogue interesting or your audience is going to give up on these characters. Adam Green's dialogue is just that, interesting. Realizing the situation the characters find themselves in, the conversations that follows feels significant, but above all genuine. Dialogue, outweighs the action, so be prepared for a lot of talking. However, when the action arrives it's like an avalanche; disastrous, yet magnetic. I was, literally, frozen, couldn't take my eyes off the screen.I've said enough...To reiterate a few points, I have to say, again, this film really shook me. After it was over I had a deeper appreciation for the bed I was watching it in. I also made a vow never, EVER to go skiing."

Then throw in a brainless 'Little Red Riding Hood' bimbo and you can call yourself a Hollywood legend.Dan, the surviving college student finally tells Parker, the constantly crying & sobbing girl, that all you need to do is CLAP and SCREAM in a threatening manner because 'the wolves are just as afraid of you as you are of them'. So...why didn't he tell this to Lynch his buddy (the grandma symbol) who broke his leg jumping off of the ski lift? No, the filmmaker had to stage a wolf attack for false savagery, gratuitous violence and lack of any other creative story line. Who ever owns these PET WOLVES and rented them out should be more than ashamed of themselves for pandering and once again stereotyping these magnificent animals into target practice in the wild. Wolves are actually shy, elusive creatures that humans rarely see because wolves know how dangerous and unpredictable humans really are.Frozen's just another sad day for endangered wolves who always end up as the primal fear image in amateur showcases of this worn out, ancient children's myth."
"39","Three college students are confined to a skilift suspended far above ground, isolated, with no one knowing about it(and no way to contact anyone), and realize that since they could be there for days while the resort is closed, they have to take matters into their own hands. That in itself wouldn't be enough to keep us interested, so there's conflict introduced right away, and the characters(and yes, we mostly focus on this trio), rather than being obnoxious, are sufficiently likable and different from one another. We have two friends that grew up together, and one of them now has a girlfriend, and that friend is now having trouble ""choosing"" between the other two, or making equal time for them. No one is shown as right or wrong in the situation, and we sympathize with all three. And yes, one of them is Iceman. I guess he doesn't have a handle on his powers yet. This is about the will to live, and we find ourselves really dreading into the threatening environment. Tension is built well(and it does not let up, there is *no* relief), there are no jumpscares, and the sound-side does much of it... we do see a bit(there's a little brutal, bloody, gory violence in this), though. I couldn't help cheer and yell advice at the screen. You want these people to make it. The acting is good. Dialog is realistic. This plays on primal fears, hypothermia, being eaten, heights, etc. The pacing is well-done, you don't stop caring... there are developments(not enough for it to be overwhelming), they're not just whining about their problem, and what happens is effective. Make-up and other FX are a bit hit and miss. This is 85 minutes sans credits. Done by the director of Spiral, while this is not as psychologically stunning as that, it does really *work*. It's entirely practically done, with no CGI, and yes, they were up there for filming. I recommend this to anyone who likes the concept. 7/10"

"42","This movie was hilarious. Other than what's been previously mentioned a hundred times on here, (the wolves, the chair lift breaking apart all of a sudden for some reason, the fact that they're freezing to death and still don't zip up there jackets or put their hands in their pockets, or the fact that the ski resort is closing in the first place) there's more that made this movie really bad. First of all, Emma Belle doesn't stop crying for the whole movie. There's minute-long shots of her snot-nosed face just bawling, and weeping, and sobbing, and it doesn't add anything to the picture. It's just filler. Like when buddy is getting eaten by wolves,it keeps cutting back to shots of her crying, but like, all the time. It's overboard. We get it, you're scared and crying, but show something else. A perfect example of that is, when the other guy climbs down the chair lift, and gets to the snowboard, and the wolves start chasing him down mountain while he rides the snowboard down, what do we see? We don't get to see the cool chase down a mountain on a snowboard with wolves chasing him. No, it just cuts to emma belle, crying her ass off again, and just sitting there. Then, later, when she gets down the mountain, we see the guys body there. Why couldn't we see the guy try to outrun the wolves on his snowboard, and then get eaten by the wolves? That would've been better. Also, when buddy has his legs broke, and he's rocking back and forth trying to get to something, I haven't laughed that hard in a while! Watch this movie if you want some kind of illogical thing to laugh at, but don't believe the obviously b.s. reviews on here talking about what a great and realistic horror/survival film this is, because it's not, and anyone who would write that is either too dumb to be trusted, or they worked on the film."
"43","One of the worst movies EVER. Do not believe any review higher than a 1 as it is a total lie told by someone profiting off of this garbage-fest.Being a life long skier, the concept appealed to me as I have considered my options when stuck on many a chair lift. However, in this idiotic world, the characters make decisions that no one would make in real life. SPOILER: The first of the three to attempt ""saving"" the trio decides to jump. Instead of getting as low as possible, this guy acts like Mark Spitz off of the high dive.......just insulting to anyone with a brain. SPOILER: It's cold, so I'll just leave my exposed hand attached to a frozen metal pole and doze off......no one would do this! And so it goes for 90 minutes or so.If this film had ANY redeeming qualities, some of the above might be able to be overlooked. Unfortunately the movie fails on all levels: Acting D; Script: F; Effects: F.Go skiing instead......DO ANYTHING instead!!!"
"44","This movie was very well made, however I wish I had never watched it. I found it to be so disturbing its all I have been able to think about all day since I watched it. I know it sounds crazy but it really has bothered me. I haven't been able to sleep all night. I just keep hearing ""Dont you let her look"" over and over again in my head. I don't think I will ever go skiing again. Anyway if you like real movies this is one for you. You can definitely see yourself in the actors ""skis"". I will never watch this movie again. It is quite graphic in certain spots. This is not a movie for children or impressionable young adults as it does leave a lasting impression and you may have some sleepless nights because of it."
"45","From a skier's point of view, the movie makes no sense but that doesn't matter. It is a good 90 minute ride that kept me interested right to the end. For its suspense/thriller/horror genre, it is a classic. The main reason I like it is the realistic ways the characters act. They are kids freezing to death on a chairlift and behave how I think they would behave facing such a situation. The bone snapping and flesh ripping is there but just at the right amount. The fear and sadness portrayed by the characters seems real to me. Do not worry about going skiing after watching this film. It simply could not happen. Enjoy the film for what it is; a chillingly, realistic portrayal of a survival situation."

"48","I'm one of the few people that enjoyed both Open Water 1 and 2. And you kind of have to like those movies, or at least part 1, to like Frozen.Two best buds, Joe (Ashmore) and Dan (Zegers) along with third-wheel, Parker (Bell) – Dan's girlfriend, swindle their way to the top of the snow covered mountain in an attempt to save money. They do this by bribing the ""guard"" Jason (Ackerman) with $100. ?? Okay, so I don't know how much it costs, but is it really a lot more than $100 between three skiers to take the lift up the mountain?At any rate, they get up there, argue, become friends again and we learn that Joe's horny and is enormously jealous of his BFF's newest partner. Of course, this is all both incidental and just the basic set up to what's to come.They want to get down the mountain on the last run on Sunday since the ski-lift's closed until the following weekend. Well, this leads to that and that leads to a ""leak"" and the threesome gets stuck over a rather large drop.At first it's funny, though a bit scary, but when the lights go out and the blizzard begins, it becomes rather desperate for our stranded ""guests."" Multiple options they come up with to get down the, probably, 4-5 story drop. You'd have to ask yourself: What would you do when it becomes increasingly fruitless that no one knows they're up there and it's not expected to move for another week?Oh, and throw in: no cell. No food or water. A razor sharp cable above that's not easy to get to. A drop surely to either kill or maim you. No one can hear you. A forest below with wolves. A mile or more from civilization. A week to wait. And well below freezing temps.Though this could happen, the set up seemed pretty silly and ill-constructed, though a bit plausible. The main movie starts when they feel they're doomed.I won't give away the depths these characters go through or the events they must endure, but I will say, despite the weak set up and almost terrible and unbelievable acting, the suspense was ENORMOUSLY high. There were times I had to look away, or fret about upcoming scenes I saw in the trailer – think A Christmas Story.So, Writer/Director Adam Green, who also did the similarly enjoyable Hatchet, did an extremely effective job of keeping me both on the edge of my seat and grossed out. I hope to see more from (and of; sorry, he's cute) him despite his movies making pennies.If you like to be frightened and love those ""If I were in their shoes, skis, fins, what would I do"" (Open Water) films, this is the movie for you. Let it simmer for a bit because when the terror sets in, it almost doesn't let up. It also helps the backdrop of the mountain's gorgeous. At least enjoy that while waiting for their fates."
"49","Yes, brutal, like a lost Stephen King short story from the seventies, one of those with a small cast of characters that keeps getting smaller. You cross your fingers and just hope the ones you're rooting for survive to the end.And terrific. The cast totally sells a script that could have either gone over the top into ""Cliffhanger"" territory or become sentimental, and ditto for the sparse direction. Nothing is wasted, everything works, and you are on the edge of your seat the whole time despite the almost non-existent plot. The script is a textbook example of taking a compelling hook and playing it out to its conclusion no matter the cost.The perfect film to watch in the dead of winter, with all the lights on and - most importantly - a fire in the fireplace. Even then... you still may not be all that glad your character made it to the last page."
