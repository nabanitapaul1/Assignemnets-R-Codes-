    Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets seePROS1.  Its easy to use2. Decent battery backup3. Live mode operation is not lagging.CONS1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.Its not worth for money

    You are on your own if you buy this product because canon local service center is of no help even in providing the product demo. We logged the complain on canon India site and not bothered to reply. Amazon call raised its hand saying ""proof of non service"" from local service center. So we have a DSLR that is producing blur images and canon is not providing any proper service. stay away

    I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything  content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn't mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same""canon"".

    Auto focus is not at all perfect.Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.Plastic quality is poor.I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300.

    Canon Has Cheated The entire photography community. if you are a photographer and use flash or studio lights this camera is not for you. do not buy external flash and studio ligits like elinchrom and godox will not work.  .reason why i am saying this.the mount on with the flash is put has one point of contact missing. in 1500d they have removed the main point of contact . 1300d has it. go for 1300d .

    If you want to upgrade your camera from point and shoot to a dslr then it is a good camera for you but if you want to start videography then don't buy it auto focus of video is too much bad. If you want  a camera for videography then go foe canon 200D or Nikon D5600

    It's a best entry level DSLR camera if you have used only point and shoot or mobile. It has built in guide which makes it easier to use and learn. The auto focus and pictures quality is also very good but some time in low lit situations it generates noiy in pictures for that use extra flash other wise best. Videos are also very good for blogging video use manual focus which is very eyes to use with best results. It's better than Nikon d3500 as videos, auto focus and features are better in this camera. If your budget is limited and you are new in DSLR then it's a must buy.

    Dear friends i buy this camera for my YouTube career<U+0001F61E> and if you’re buying this camera for your YouTube career then its not for you. Bcz this camera doesn’t have mic input, and its also not takes a great videos, you’re not able to record great videos without mic input. No auto focus option in video recording, basic camera <U+0001F4F7>!! This camera only good for pictures clicks!

    I paid Rs 20240 for this product and have read some of the reviews, and  I can say I bought it expensive. Some people got it for Rs 18000 in the offer period. I tried some of its features and felt terribly disappointed. The autofocus is a joke here. It takes forever to click a photo in just slightest low light. I was very annoyed. I feel like I should have bought a cyber shot instead. Nikon D3500 is way better than it hands down in terms of clarity of photographs, quality, ISO, battery, grip and display. However, you'll have to pay Rs 3000-4000 more, but that's worth it. You don't buy DSLRs every day. Choose a better camera.

Otherwise....*Excellent DSLR for beginners.*Easy to use.*Good quality.*Decent battery backup.*Worth for moneyFact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)

    Thanks to amazon and the courier partner for the quick delivery. Well it was an awesome deal from amazon purchased it for around <U+20B9>21.5k with a free gift Motorola wired headphone worth <U+20B9>650.Coming to the camera it’s a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera.

At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX

    I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment.

Tried contacting CX care a number times and nobody were of any help to me. Atlease got a chance to ask for assistance regarding the return. I still have it packed as it is.. I am not at all happy with the product and have not even charged the battery even once.

    This may be a good camera for the very experienced professional of photography. It is challenging for a newcomer in photography.1-Flash Makes too much noise2-You cannot record a  good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.4-Wifi does not control the video recording function5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it

    Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue.

    For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography.

    Great product, I naught this 1 day before my family trip. Had no professional photography experience still the pictures were perfect (through auto mode)Have been exploring the features for while now and if a beginner is looking for phone then this is must have.I ordered for only 1 lens and now I regret the decision as the 55-250 lens is very costly if naught separately. Would suggest anyone to go for both lenses if the budget permits. Though the 18-55 lens is just fine but if you need to zoom more then not much helpful.

    I am using this for couple of months. In this model Canon has removed the center pin in Hot Shoe. Hence most of cheaper after market external Speedlight flashes cannot be used in this DSLR model.

Inbuilt Flash is of no use.

Tried Clicking some Pictures of Potraits, Close Up's and in Flash off Mode and the Results had Awestruck me!Also Connected the Camera to My Mobile Using WiFi and Canon Camera Connect App from PlayStore as this Product supports WiFi and NFC. Using Remote Access I had Controlled Camera and clicked Few Images and it seemed perfect. WoWI have Noticed that Autofocus is a Bit Slow. Will talk about this in the later part after proper utilisation.I Conclude that this is a Must buy Camera for Beginners and Hobby Photographers at a very Reasonable Price.

    Bought it for my dad and would recommend it for absolute beginners who want to grow out of mobile photography and get some more out of their clicks.If are buying this camera, stop shooting in auto mode as auto mode is same as a mobile camera so not worth buying of you'll be shooting auto. Buy a point and shoot instead if you'll just be using auto.Also buy only for photography, Video recording is garbage and you would be better of recording from a mobile camera.In short, great for beginner photographers as a first dslr.

    Very beginner friendly. I bought it for my cousin  who is a complete newbie in photography. And he took this picture (attached) in his first day. The focus speed is not as good as Nikon entry levels, and the battery backup is slightly worse as well. But the color profile is much better in Canon. The details are very close to Nikon D5600. Only major negative is fixed display. But again wifi mobile  connection really helps.

    DO NOT BUYCanon has tried to create monopoly through this model. Hot shoe has been changed so now only canon flash lights will  work with this model i.e. Canon eos 1500d.They have NOT even mentioned this anywhere on amazon or on their website, not even the dealers of canon know this new development.The LCD screen could have been given a flap covering which was in previous models.

    Ok but not useful with basic lens provided with it...pictures are look like you are taken with mobile camera ...pic you are thinking of to taken with dslr are only comes with higher lenses you used ...either you go for 50-250 or 70-300 but basic lens 15-55 are useless.

    Bought this camera for about 23000.The camera was packed pretty well.The camera is really good for beginners.Some people say the kit lens is bad but I feel you can get some pretty decent shots once you learn how to use it.The auto focus is not that good so I recommend you use the manual focus,just to get your perfect shot.one of the reasons I bought this camera is because of the wifi function.It works really well and it is convenient .

    Nikon 3400 is better than 3500 so don't buy nikon 3500.But i choose canon 1500 because wifi , camera app, You definitely need extra lens. 50mm is good because i though kit lens is ok for me but believe me  you definitely need extra lens. Zoom lens is not you need so don't buy with combo lens. Go for 50 mm lens. Now one more thing

    I am using past 6 months and till now I am very much satisfied from this product using day light photography but I do not know what settings are required to capture night light photo.. using default auto setting. So it's drawback or my lack of knowledge. If I get setting details from product seller then fine picture quality at night then I will revise my rating.

    I like  very much this  , image quality is vet nice First things first, it’s an incredibly functional DSLR that takes sharp images with a natural feel to them and also offers a good video quality. More importantly for beginners, however, it manages to do that right out of the box, which allows beginners to get taking great pictures and recording quality videos as soon as they unbox the DSLR.
  
"
"77","







  
  
    Main drawback is that, It does not have 3.5 mm jack for recording audio... A connector to connect its mini usb port to 3.5 mm jack should be in its accessories

    As expected, the entry level DSLR is best for beginners. Its easy to operate. I got 18-55 lense which is good for all except zoom, only 3x. However, you have to buy a zoom lens for that purpose. Battery is also good. It lasts the whole day with continuous shooting.

    I received the product on 4.10.2019. When I tried to register the product with the website of canon to get extended warranty, it is revealed that the product has already been registered on 13.06.2019. So, the warranty would expire on 12.6.2021. It is also revealed that the supplier's name is incorrect, when I entered the details of the supplier on the website of canon, which is the same as shown in the invoice. To net result is that the warranty is reduced by two and a half months. I have reason to believe that it is a used product. The vendor is expected to you answer my doubts

    This camera is very good for beginners.  U can go with 1500 or 3000d . But the picture quality  and video quality in 1500d is not that mark . Its auto fuces is too bad . If I r vlogger and have less bought pls get your self better mobile , this camera is not for videos. It record videos at 1080p 30 fps . 720p 50 fps . Video samples  are quit good and above average.  Go with prime lens 18 55mm lens for boke or blue background for u r photos and videos quit better then 3000d .

    This is a very suitable, easy to handle DSLR camera for people who want to start out with digital photography. I was able to operate this camera very easily after learning different functionalities by watching several videos online. Strongly recommended for people with no or very little exposure to DSLR. One can always choose to buy a better lens later if they feel like upgrading the quality of the pictures.

    It is best for daylight shoots not perfect for night shoots........... It is used for the beginner because I am also a beginner....With modeling, you pose.

Even my wife is also much comfortable using this camera since it has screen view mode. Also the automode sets the ISO and white balance allowing clicking shots without looking for a setting if u r in a hurry. Wifi connect is very convinient. U can just download whichever image u like.

    Budget DSLR. Photo qualities of flowers are awesome. But normal photography is average equivalent to good quality images of photo captured from most of the mobile phone except pixels.Clearity is good which can't be available in most of the image captured from mobile ..there is no in built image effect. So image u will get will be original.So it can be tried. But if u have budget,I will guggest better to go for higher version .

So far, good to practice your skills on, but definitely would suggest to move on to other better options quickly.It comes with a kit lense and a kit bag to hold the camera body, lense and batterycharger, but the holding loop of the bag got torn off on the second day !!!...

    If you are going with this camera then fine but you can't use third party additional flash light you have to bought canon flash which is costing more than 20000 so I prefer if you want to use it with additional so don't buy it otherwise for normal purpose at-home it is fine

    It's more suitable DSLR camera for beginners. It's got great auto focus and couple of modes for varied kind of shots. Also it has benefit of wireless picture snapping via NFC/Mobile app, which can also live view the picture taken and transfer the pictures/videos on the go.

    Not Good For Begineers. Not able to autofocus while shooting videos. the picture quality is just okay. Nikon point & sooot camera is better than this.

    If you are a beginner go for it .The auto focus is just fine, speaking about picture quality the 24 mp works fine even in low light

    Unbelievable picture quality for the price, just become familiar with the camera once you are set you might have to adjust shutter speeds for low light but all in all great for beginners, but if you are getting it for blogging or YouTube spend 12k extra and get 200d it will be more apt for you and it also has dual pixel auto focus for fast moving objects
